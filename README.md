CivWikiPageLinks

A small data-science (ish) project to map and then subsequently PageRank pages on a smaller, yet substantial wiki. (at https://civwiki.org, where I'm a little bit of a contributor.)

Mostly this is just a place to store some cleaned data.

- cleaner_links.csv is all the links between all main namespace pages, filtered for section links, subpages, non-existent pages, etc.
- redirects.csv is a csv with all redirect pages.
- page_refs_clean.csv is a csv with ALL links, even on non-main namespace pages. (Most notably, many pages here were imported from older wikis from previous iterations of this wiki.)
- page_titles.csv is a csv with all page titles.

Thanks to Gjum for some help with getting the data sets.
